# MiniCalculator
This is a mini calculator that can calculate multiplication and division.

For multiplication, the unit tests that I made check an integer times an integer, 
an integer times a negative integer, and an integer times 0.

For division, the unit tests check an integer divided by another integer, and an
integer divided by a negative integer.

For calculate, the unit test checks if the inputted integer returns the same as the outputted integer.
